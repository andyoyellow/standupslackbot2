# This is a simple example of how to use the slack-client module in CoffeeScript. It creates a
# bot that responds to all messages in all channels it is in with a reversed
# string of the text received.
#
# To run, copy your token below, then, from the project root directory:
#
# To run the script directly
#    npm install
#    node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee examples/simple_reverse.coffee 
#
# If you want to look at / run / modify the compiled javascript
#    npm install
#    node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee -c examples/simple_reverse.coffee 
#    cd examples
#    node simple_reverse.js
